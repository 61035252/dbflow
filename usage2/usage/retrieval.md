# Retrieval

DBFlow provides a few ways to retrieve information from the database. Through the `Model` classes we can map this information to easy-to-use objects.

DBFlow provides a few different ways to retrieve information from the database. We can retrieve synchronously or asynchronous \(preferred\).

We can also use `ModelView` \([read here](modelviews.md)\) and `@Index` \([read here](../../advanced-usage/indexing.md)\) to perform faster retrieval on a set of data constantly queried.

## Synchronous Retrieval

Using the [SQLite query language](sqlitewrapperlanguage.md) we can retrieve data easily and expressively. To perform it synchronously:

```kotlin
databaseForTable<Employee> { db ->
    // list
    val employees = (select from Employee::class).queryList(db)
    
    // single result, we apply a limit(1) automatically to get the result even faster.
    val employee: Employee? = (select from Employee::class
                            where Employee_Table.name.eq("Andrew Grosner")).querySingle(db)
    
    // can require result to get non-null if you know it exists
    // throws a SQLiteException if missing
    val employee: Employee? = (select from Employee::class
                            where Employee_Table.name.eq("Andrew Grosner")).requireSingle(db)
    
    // get a custom list
    val employees: List<AnotherTable> = (select from Employee::class)
                    .queryCustomList(database)
    
    // custom object
    val anotherObject: AnotherTable? = (select from Employee::class
                            where(Employee_Table.name.eq("Andrew Grosner")))
                            .queryCustomSingle()
                            
    // require custom object
    val anotherObject: AnotherTable = (select from Employee::class
                            where(Employee_Table.name.eq("Andrew Grosner")))
                            .requireCustomSingle()
}
```

To query custom objects or lists, see how to do so in [QueryModel](../../advanced-usage/querymodels.md).

Also you can query a `FlowCursorList`/`FlowTableList` from a query easily via `queryCursorList()` and the `queryTableList()` methods. To see more on these, go to [Flow Lists](../../advanced-usage/listbasedqueries.md).

## Asynchronous Retrieval

DBFlow provides the very-handy `Transaction` system that allows you to place all calls to the DB in a background queue. Using this system, we recommend placing retrieval queries on this queue to help prevent locking and threading issues when using a database.

We wrap our queries in a `beginTransactionAsync` block, executing and providing call backs to the method as follows:

```kotlin
database.beginTransactionAsync { db ->
  // body of transaction. Return the value you wish to pass into the Success callback.
  (select from TestModel1::class
    where TestModel1_Table.name.is("Async")).querySingle(db)
  }
    .execute(
     ready = { transaction -> }, // called when transaction is ready to be executed.
     success = { transaction, r ->   }, // if successful
     error  = { transaction, throwable ->  }, // any exception thrown is put here
     completion = { transaction -> }) // always called success or failure
```

A `ITransaction<R>` simply returns a result, `R` , which could be a query, or a result from multiple queries combined into one result.

By default the library uses an ordered queue that executes FIFO \(first-in-first-out\) and blocks itself until new `Transaction` are added. Each subsequent call to the `database.beginTransactionAsync` places a new transaction on this queue.

If you wish to customize and provide a different queue \(or map it to an existing system\), read up on [Transactions](storingdata.md). We also provide constructs such as coroutines and RX `Observables` to map to your team's needs.
